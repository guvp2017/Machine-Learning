## Machine-Learning
#### Four ML Projects
Use Python Spyder to conduct these case studies: (1) Set up grid search function for large number of classifiers and hyperparameter settings; (2) Investigate specific claims in a large dataset (500,000 instances, 29 attributes), create best models with GridSearchCV for claim prediction, and find the predominately influencing attributes; (3) Recommendation system and decision making with matrices.
